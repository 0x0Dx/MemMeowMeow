# 🐾 **MemMeowMeow – The Cutest Menace to Your Memory**

MemMeowMeow is a _tiny, adorable, slightly feral_ memory scanner and editor that tip-taps through your system RAM like a mischievous kitten knocking cups off tables.

It does **process scanning**, **value editing**, **freezing**, and other serious things—
but with **silly little paws**.

Use responsibly. Meow responsibly. 😼
